# Omni Wx

**Omni Wx** is a multi-lens weather intelligence application designed for land, sea, sky, and extreme conditions.

The app combines radar, mapping, and domain-specific overlays into a single cohesive experience, with progressive disclosure from simple views to advanced, professional tools.

## Current Focus
- **Land Wx**: Animated radar with smooth timeline scrubbing
- Docked map UI designed to avoid control overlap
- Provider-agnostic radar architecture
- Android native builds via Expo EAS

## Planned Lenses
- **Land** — radar, wildfire, surface conditions
- **Nautical** — buoys, sea state, marine warnings
- **Astro** — cloud cover, seeing, light pollution
- **Chase** — hyper-local radar and storm tools (future)

## Tech Stack
- React Native (Expo)
- Map rendering via RN Maps and MapLibre (abstracted)
- Modular overlay system with performance guardrails
- Android builds via EAS

## Status
Early development. Architecture and core radar workflows are being established before expanding overlays and professional tools.
